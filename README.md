## Project Overview

The **AI Forum** is a web-based platform built as part of a university project to demonstrate a fully functional forum system. It allows users to register, log in, create posts, comment on posts, and manage their content. Administrators have additional privileges to manage users, posts, and comments via an admin dashboard. The project includes features like pagination, search functionality, and content truncation for a better user experience.

The project was developed with a focus on security (e.g., preventing SQL injection and XSS attacks), usability (e.g., pagination and search), and adherence to Johannes‚Äô BrightlingWiki PHP Styleguide for consistent coding practices.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Register with a username, email, and password.
  - Log in and log out securely with session management.
  - Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` for security.

- **Post Management**:
  - Create, edit, and delete posts (for post owners and admins).
  - View a paginated list of posts with 5 posts per page.
  - Search posts by title or content.
  - Truncate post content longer than 200 characters with a "Vollst√§ndige Ansicht" toggle button.

- **Comment System**:
  - Add, edit, and delete comments on posts (for comment owners and admins).
  - Toggle visibility of comments with a "Kommentare anzeigen" button.

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Manage users (delete users, with a safeguard preventing self-deletion).
  - Manage posts and comments (edit or delete any post/comment).

- **Pagination**:
  - Navigate through posts with Previous/Next links and page numbers.
  - Automatically redirect to the last valid page if an invalid page is accessed.

- **Search Functionality**:
  - Search posts by title or content using a search form.
  - Reset search to view all posts with a "Suche zur√ºcksetzen" link.

- **Security**:
  - SQL injection prevention using prepared statements.
  - XSS prevention by escaping database outputs with `rpl()` and user inputs with `htmlspecialchars()`.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling), JavaScript (for toggling content and comments).
  - WOW.js for fade-in animations.

- **Backend**:
  - PHP 8.1+ (with MySQLi for database interactions).
  - Session-based authentication.

- **Database**:
  - MySQL (MariaDB compatible).

- **Server**:
  - XAMPP (for local development).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- XAMPP (or any PHP/MySQL server) installed.
- Git (to clone the repository).
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-link>
   cd Website-Basis-Forum


2. Set Up the Database:
Start XAMPP and ensure Apache and MySQL are running.
Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
Create a new database named ai_forum.
Import the ai_forum.sql file (located in the sql/ directory) to set up the tables and sample data.

3. Configure Database Connection:
Open inc/db_connect.php and update the database credentials if necessary:
php
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "ai_forum");

4. Run the Project:
Move the project folder to C:\xampp\htdocs\ (or your XAMPP htdocs directory).
Access the project in your browser: http://localhost/Website-Basis-Forum/index.php.

5. Test with Sample Users:

Admin User:
Email: madhuri@gmail.com
Password: admin123

Regular User:
Email: user1@gmail.com
Password: (hashed in the database, use the "Forgot Password" feature or register a new user).
